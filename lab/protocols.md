# PROTOCOLS
*****
[Note: ul stands for 10⁻⁶ liters]
## Agarose gel (100 ml)
_(Yet to improve:)_
- See table for concentration of Agarose -> fill prortion: 1% = 1 g for 100ml
- Add 100 ml of TXB
- Add saver safe 5 ml for 100 ml

## Acrylamide fixation
Based on [bio-rad data sheet](http://www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_9413.pdf) page 7


| ul  | Compounds (Total: ~1ml)|
|-----|----------------|
| 660 | Acrylamide at 30% |
| 335 | H20            |
| 0.5 | TEMED          |
| 5* | Ammonium persulfate (APS) at 10%|

Once all compounds added mix them up.

_*APS (actually TEMED too) has to be added just before the desired embedding and the process has to be done quickly since polymerization is pretty fast._

## Digestion Mix

| ul                | Compounds for n digestions (Total: 10ul · n)|
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 · n             | Smart Buffer              |
| 7.6* __:__ 7.8 · n | H20                       |
| 0.2 **:** 0.1 · n | Enzyme 1                  |
| 0.2 **:** 0.1 · n | Enzyme 2                  |
| 1 · n             | DNA                       |

_*Volume in the n=1 case._

## Ligation Mix

| ul  | Compounds for one ligation (Total: 5ul)|
|-----|---------------------------|
| 0.5 | T4 Buffer 10x             |
| 0.5 | DNA 1                     |
| 0.5 | DNA 2                     |
| 0.5 | DNA 3                     |
| 3   | H20                       |
| 0.2 | T4 ligase*                |

_*Ligase should be added at the end._
